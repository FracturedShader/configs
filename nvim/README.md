# About
Configurations for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) requiring at least v0.9.0

Mainly a custom combination of [Jon Gjengset's Neovim configs](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs/tree/master/editor/.config/nvim) and [The Ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) with some personal modifications for my workflows and preferences.

# Dependencies
These config files depend on some things not included here. Namely:
- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugin management
- [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) for Rust development
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for enhanced search
- [ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls) for C++ development
